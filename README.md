# Hello ! Thanks for being there ! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my [Github profile](https://github.com/lhenault) ! I'm Louis, a machine learning engineer and tech enthusiast. I've spent the past years building and deploying ML systems, and enjoy every creative use of new technologies.


## Architecture and usage

*Louis* isn't using any complex architecture, isn't horizontally scalable and no, you cannot clone this repo and do this : 

```
docker build . -t Louis
```

If you're still interested in my project, do not hesitate to contact me.

## FAQ

- **Where can I learn more about you ?**

- You can see my resume and other things on [my website](https://louishenault.com). Also do not hesitate to get in touch or to [add me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/louishenault/).

- **Why is your GitHub almost empty ? Do you know how to code ?**

- Unfortunately, I was working on different and private Git platforms for most of my works, and side projects. So, not a lot of green squares there but I'm planning to work on it. ðŸ˜„
