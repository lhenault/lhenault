# Hello ! Thanks for being there ! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my [Github profile](https://github.com/lhenault) ! I'm Louis, a machine learning engineer and tech enthusiast. I've spent the past years building and deploying ML systems, and enjoy every creative use of new technologies.

## Some fancy stuffs I've worked on

- I've helped Netflix to launch in France, through large-scale social media analysis and [topic modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model). See more [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W76Sc6lmOvA).

- I've trained and deployed GAN and NLP models to create new contents, with applications to product design and marketing, and just for fun and creative purposes. A few samples can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWBj7IicECo) or [there](/static/gan-hair.jpg).

- I've built deep learning models and tools for feature learning, content discovery and data exploration, that have been deployed to hundreds of users and [showcased in big tech events](https://youtu.be/0P_WqF6cLAs?t=129).


## Architecture and usage

*Louis* isn't using any complex architecture, isn't horizontally scalable and no, you cannot clone this repo and do this : 

```
docker build . -t Louis
```

On the other hand, he can help you achieve this for your projects. If you're still interested in my project, do not hesitate to contact me.

## FAQ

- **Where can I learn more about you ?**

- You can see my resume and other things on [my website](https://louishenault.com). Also do not hesitate to get in touch or to [add me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/louishenault/).

- **Why is your GitHub almost empty ? Do you know how to code ?**

- Unfortunately, I was working on different and private Git platforms for most of my works, and side projects. So, not a lot of green squares there but I'm planning to work on it. ðŸ˜„
