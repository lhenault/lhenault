# Hello ! Thanks for being there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my [Github profile](https://github.com/lhenault)! I'm Louis, a London based machine learning engineer and tech enthusiast. I've spent the past years building and deploying ML systems, and enjoy every creative use of new technologies.

## Some mildly interesting projects I've worked on

- I've trained and deployed ML systems for Red Bull Racing, helping the team to secure both world [driver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_World_Drivers%27_Champions) and [constructor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Formula_One_World_Constructors%27_Champions) championships.

- I'm working on a [project](https://github.com/lhenault/simpleAI) to replicate the OpenAI's API and allowing people to easily expose their own LLM through a REST API.

- I've helped Netflix launch their platform in France, through large-scale social media analysis and [topic modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model). See more [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W76Sc6lmOvA). This project got several awards in 2014 at the [Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity](https://www.canneslions.com/).

- I've trained and deployed GAN and NLP models to create new content, with applications to product design and marketing, and just for fun and creative purposes. A few samples can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWBj7IicECo) or [there](/static/gan-hair.jpg).

- I've built deep learning models and tools for feature learning, content discovery and data exploration, that have been deployed for and used by hundreds of internal users, and [showcased in big tech events](https://youtu.be/0P_WqF6cLAs?t=129).

## FAQ

- **Where can I learn more about you?**

- You can see my resume and other things on [my website](https://louishenault.com). Also do not hesitate to get in touch on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/lhenault/) or to [add me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/louishenault/).

- **You look cool, can we get a coffee and chat about ML?**

- I'm always happy to connect with people sharing similar interests, so if you're around let me know. And as we're all connected through this "internet" thing, if you're far you can always drop me a message.
